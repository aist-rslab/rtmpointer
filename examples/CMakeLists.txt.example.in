# Search for dependencies
find_package(rtmpointer REQUIRED)
# Searching for rtmpointer will bring in the OpenRTM compile/link
# information as well. You can also search for it explicitly by uncommenting
# the following lines.
#
## Add the directory containing the modules to the CMake search path.
## This is needed to use the FindOpenRTM.cmake modules with
## find_package.
#list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH @CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/@SHARE_INSTALL_DIR@)
## On Windows, if you set the RTMDSS_ROOT environment variable to the location
## where rtmpointer was installed, the above line can be replaced with:
## list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${RTMDSS_ROOT}/@SHARE_INSTALL_DIR@)
## Search for OpenRTM.
#find_package(OpenRTM 1 REQUIRED)
